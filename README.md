# House of Lines Solution

## Purpose
To determine given a graph which contains a valid Euler path, determine how many Euler paths exists

## Explanation
While the intent is to provide a JS function to determine how many different types of Euler path's there are for a given valid Euler path. I have not been able to find a solution for this. So until then, the goal is to describe and run both algorithms that currently can define whether a Euler path exists or not. The O notation is found on each page for each algorithm. The JS code that is currently being run is from (https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/algorithms/graph/eulerian-path)

## How to Use
This will generate a static website using nodeJS. Clone the repo to your local machine and run `node server.js` and the site will pop up on `localhost:3000` containing a link that will ask you the number of even nodes and odd nodes. This will return the number of valid paths, the time it takes to calculate, and the Big O notation for calculating this
