# House of Lines Solution

## Purpose
To determine given a graph which contains a valid Euler path, determine how many Euler paths exists

## How to Use
This will generate a static website using nodeJS. Clone the repo to your local machine and run `node server.js` and the site will pop up on `localhost:5000` containing a link that will ask you the number of even nodes and odd nodes. This will return the number of valid paths, the time it takes to calculate, and the Big O notation for calculating this
